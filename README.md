# Text_Classification_Model-on_Song_Lyrics
In this project, I built a text classification model on song lyrics. The task is to predict the artist from a piece of text. To train such a model, first, I collected my own lyrics' dataset. Initially, I downloaded HTML pages with links to songs and parsed them. I extracted hyperlinks of song pages and downloaded and extracted the song lyrics. In addition, I vectorized the texts using the Bag Of Words method and trained a classification model that predicts the artist from a piece of text.
